**US Visa Approval Prediction**

**üîç Description for US Visa Approval Prediction for Machine Learning Model - MLOps Project:**

The US Visa Approval Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the approval or rejection of US visa applications. This project adopts a modular coding approach, leveraging various technologies to build an end-to-end solution. The primary technologies used in this project include:

**üêç Python:** Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language for machine learning, is employed for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

**üìì Jupyter Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive and collaborative environment to explore and analyze the data, experiment with different algorithms, and fine-tune the model parameters.

**üñ•Ô∏è Visual Studio Code:** Visual Studio Code, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE), is utilized for writing modular and scalable code. It enables efficient coding practices, debugging, and version control integration with Git, ensuring better collaboration among team members.

**üçÉ MongoDB:** MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, is used to store and manage the visa application data. It provides flexibility and scalability for handling large datasets efficiently.

**üêô GitHub:** GitHub serves as the version control and collaboration platform, allowing team members to work together, track changes, and manage the project's codebase effectively.

**‚ö° FastAPI:**  FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs, is used to create a robust and scalable API for serving the machine learning model predictions. It offers high performance and automatic documentation generation.

**‚òÅÔ∏è AWS S3:**  AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is utilized for storing and managing the dataset and other project-related files. It provides secure and scalable cloud storage for easy accessibility and data sharing.

By combining these technologies, the US Visa Approval Prediction project aims to develop a reliable and efficient machine learning model that can assist in predicting the outcome of US visa applications, streamlining the visa approval process, and improving decision-making.
